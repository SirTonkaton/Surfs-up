# Surfs-up

This analysis was completed to provide back up information in regards opening a surf shop in the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Data was collected and pulled specifically for the months of June and December in order to consider the recorded temperatures a key variable for opening the shop year round.
If the average temperature was the only variable to consider when making a final decision, my vote based on the information we have is to go ahead and open the shop.

### Comparring June and December

After comparing the average temperature from June going forward, we can deduct that there is a variance of 3.9 Degrees. While on the months of August, September and October the temperature stays around 76 degrees, the islands eventually strat to cool down.

Based on the table above, the second half of the year is an attraction to those that want to get away and Surf-Up. Staying above 70 degrees in the winter months definetely gives us a greater chance to remain open year round.
