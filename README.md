# Surfs-up

This analysis was completed to provide back up information in regards opening a surf shop in the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Data was collected and pulled specifically for the months of June and December in order to consider the recorded temperatures a key variable for opening the shop year round.
If the average temperature was the only variable when making a final decision, my vote is to go ahead and open the shop.

## Recorded data for June 

As you will see below, for the month of June the average temperature was 74.94 degrees.

### Comparing June and December

After comparing the average temperature from June going forward, we can deduct that there is a variance of 3.9 Degrees. While on the months of August, September and October the temperature stayed around 76 degrees, the islands eventually started to cool down.

When comparing June and December, we can deduct the following:
  1. June is the first month of summer and temperature data shows that at 74.94 degrees, marketing ice cream should be easy.
  2. For at least 100 times during the day while tempratures are being recorded, on both months data shows that we will be at the 72-76 degree mark.
  3. Timing of each recording during the day is not the same. For this document, June reported 1,700 readings while December only reported 1,517 readings.   

Based on the table above, the second half of the year is an attraction to those that want to get away and Surf-Up. Staying above 70 degrees in the winter months definetely gives us a greater chance to remain open year round.

## Items to consider

1. It would be beneficial to get some data in regards the number of visitors and the trends for the year on each one of the Hawaiian Islands. The more visitors, the greater chance for us to offer our services.
2. Identify the number of similar businesses in the area where we think would be the best location for the shop. This will help us determine a marketing strategy by focusing on the one concept that will atract the most visitors.
